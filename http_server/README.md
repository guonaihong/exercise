Mascot: Tortoises

Function name to "tor" as a prefix

Tortoises (/ˈtɔːr.təs.ɪz/, Testudinidae) are a family of land-dwelling reptiles in the order Testudines.
Like other turtles, tortoises are shielded from predators by a shell.
The top part of the shell is the carapace, the underside is the plastron, and the two are connected by the bridge.
The tortoise endoskeleton has the adaptation of having an external shell fused to the ribcage.
Tortoises can vary in size from a few centimeters to two meters.
They are usually diurnal animals with tendencies to be crepuscular depending on the ambient temperatures.
They are generally reclusive animals.
